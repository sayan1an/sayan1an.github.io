   abstract = {Friction is a complex phenomenon resulting from elastic and plastic deformations coupled with molecular interaction along the contact boundary. When two surfaces touch, their roughness, and normal force determines the actual area under contact, governing the process of deformation and molecular interaction. A typical macroscopic interaction may involve millions of microscopic contacts and the aggregate of these forces give rise to the phenomenon of friction. In this thesis, our goal is to simulate the phenomenon of friction assuming unlubricated contact and elastic deformation at the contact asperities. We collect data by varying many parameters that affect friction between two surfaces and build a function approximator exploiting the correlation in data. Such an approximator is a computationally inexpensive, versatile and more accurate substitute for friction coefficient tables currently in use with various physically based simulators.},
